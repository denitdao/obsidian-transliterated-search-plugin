# Obsidian Transliterated Search Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that allows you to search non latin characters in Obsidian. 
It uses the transliteration library to convert non latin characters to latin characters. 

For example, if you search for \"Джон\" it will return all the files that contain \"Джон\" or \"John\".

**NOTE:** It's usefult for everyone who has Obsidian notes in multiple languages.

### TODO:
[] Add vice versa transliteration (from latin to non latin)
[] Add support for other languages
[] Add language translation configuration
