# Obsidian Transliterated Search Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that allows you to search non latin characters in Obsidian. 
It uses the transliteration library to convert non latin characters to latin characters. 

For example, if you search for \"Мастер\" it will return all the files that contain \"Мастер\" or \"Master\".

**NOTE:** It's usefult for everyone who has Obsidian notes in multiple languages.
